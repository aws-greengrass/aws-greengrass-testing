## AWS Greengrass Testing Framework

This framework is a collection of building blocks
to support end to end automation from the customer
perspective, using Cucumber as the feature driver. AWS Greengrass uses these very same building
blocks to qualify software changes on variable devices.

## What's inside?

- AWS Resource Management
- A platform abstraction over Java Process API
- A bunch of common steps
- Ability for the features to be driven through IDT.
- Service discovery for extensions like other AWS resources, steps, and configuration.
